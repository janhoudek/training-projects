# training-projects
Collection of small projects where I am learning to programming.

This repository includes various mini apps, scripts, and exercises created as part of my programming journey. The goal is to practice the basics, explore new technologies, and improve over time.

Includes for example:
- Automation scripts in Python
- Simple web applications
- Working with APIs
- Small database projects
- Algorithmic exercises

Each project has its own folder with a description and any relevant notes.
